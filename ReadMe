Run:
> g++ -Wall -std=c++11 main.cpp
> ./a.out
in the terminal.

This will call the InputFileGenerator program to create 25 files for each input file then
calcluate how long it takes to sort each file and the average per input size.

These values are recorded in "Eta_David_executionTime.txt" and"Eta_David_averageExecutionTime.txt" respectively.

This does not depend on any other program to run as the files it is dependent on (such as "InputFileGenerator.cpp" and "Eta_David_QuickSort.cpp") have been replicated into header files which were called in the file.



# Eta_David_averageExecutionTime.txt
If the program does not run, be sure to create this file and make sure it is empty before running it.
This holds the average time each set of 25 files of a number of numbers takes to be sorted in milliseconds.


# Eta_David_executionTime.txt
If the program does not run, be sure to create this file and make sure it is empty before running it.
This holds how long it takes to run quicksort on each file in milliseconds. 


# Makefile
This can run the main.cpp file exactly as it should be run as well as clean out the other files before starting a new session.
